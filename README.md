Slides, code and data repository for the course *Statistical Methods in Infectious Disease Epidemiology* at the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute of the University of Zurich, Spring 2021. The course is given by [Michael HÃ¶hle](https://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/) and [Maria Dunbar](https://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/en/aboutus/departments/biostatistics/teambiostats/dunbar_maria.html).

## Course contents
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that infectious diseases remain a continuous threat to human health. Understanding and controlling infectious diseases is thus a key element of public health and the role of statistics in this task is to bring stochastic models and observational data into sync when trying to characterize the biological and social processes governing disease spread. This course gives an overview on how such statistical modelling methods for infectious disease dynamics look and how they can be applied in practice. Contents of the course are as follows:

* Introduction to epidemic modelling
     -   Compartmental models Deterministic and stochastic SIR-type models
     -   Simulation and inference for SIR-type models
* Reproduction numbers and their estimation Incubation period, serial interval, generation time and their estimation
* Delays
     -   Back-calculation method
     -   Nowcasting 
 * Vaccination: effectiveness, efficacy and safety
 * Temporal and spatio-temporal detection of clusters
 * COVID-19 modelling
